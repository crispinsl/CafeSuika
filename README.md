# CafeSuika

Trying to play around with adding mechanics to the classic 'Suika' game (also called The Watermelon Game). It's combining Suika with chaotic restaurant-themed games.

-MECHANICS
-Typical Suika mechanics, puzzle revolving around a sort of Tetris-like puzzle game but with added features such as smaller, timed levels.
-Some of the 'circles' (or fruit, in the original game) can't combine. They represent different coffee orders.
For instance:
-Customer orders a frappe. You have to make sure the white circles representing 'creamer' combine into their second teir, 'foam'. You then have to try and make sure brown circles representing coffee beans combine into third teir 'cappuchino'. 
-The order is done and the level is complete.
-(I will have to do research on common coffee recipes...)

-DYNAMICS
-Main issue is getting essentially two games of Suika to play nice with each other the whole time.

-AESTHETICS
-2D side view with cafe themed elements
-Cute but not ... 'cozy indie game' cute?
-Will be using my own hand drawn elements
